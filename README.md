# FireChat

An example how to use React Native + Firebase to create a messaging app

#### I have used the following technologies:
- Navigation using [ex-navigation](https://github.com/exponentjs/ex-navigation)
- Firebase as our backend
- [Gifted Chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) for messaging screen

#### Here is a preview of the app:
